*What are Data Structures?
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
  
*Types of Data Structure
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

Linear data structure
Non-linear data structure

*Linear data structures
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other.
Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
-------------------------------------------------------------(I)Linear Data Structure------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Array Data Structure
In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. 
All the elements of an array are of the same type. 
And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.
  
2. Stack Data Structure
In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.
  
3. Queue Data Structure
Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.

4. Linked List Data Structure
In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes.
And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.

----------------------------------------------------------------(II)Non linear data structures-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence.
Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.
  
  
1. Graph Data Structure
In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.
  
  
2. Trees Data Structure
Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.
